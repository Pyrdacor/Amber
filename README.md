# Amber

**Note: This is still in early development. Many things will change and be added.**

This repository contains libraries to implement games of the Amber trilogy for modern platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.

Many parts are designed in a way that they can be used or extended for different environments, game data providers, renderers, sound backends and so on.

## Amberstar

Currently Amberstar is ported to modern platforms based on this new project so the Amberstar related parts are kept here as well for easier development. At some point they will move to their own repository though.
