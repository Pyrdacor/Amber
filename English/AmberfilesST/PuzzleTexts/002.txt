A REVERBERATING VOICE SAYS : # # "WELCOME TO THE ALTAR OF REUNIFICATION . # EACH PIECE OF THE AMBERSTAR STANDS FOR THE BEINGS AND GODS WHO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THIS HISTORY . CHOOSE THE PLACES FOR THE PIECES VERY CAREFULLY AND THE AMBERSTAR WILL BECOME ONE AGAIN . # # BUT YOU MUST ALSO BE WARNED : # IF YOU PUT ONE OF THE PIECES IN THE WRONG PLACE YOU WILL MEET YOUR DEATH . # # WITH THESE WORDS THE PIECES OF THE AMBERSTAR BEGIN TO GLOW AND IN EACH PIECE YOU SEE A SYMBOL AND A NAME .
