AFTER THE BATTLE , THE REMAINS ARE TRANSFORMED AGAIN INTO THE SHAPE OF THE GIRL . AS YOU NOW WALK UP TO HER ANOTHER TRANSFORMATION TAKES PLACE . HER BODY DECOMPOSES SLOWLY AND THE ONLY THING WHICH REMAINS IS A BARE SKELETON . IN ADDITION YOU SEEM TO HEAR A DISTANT VOICE SAYING : # # "THANK YOU FOR RELEASING ME!"
