AS YOU GO TO THE BARS OF THE CAGE , THE GIRL NOTICES YOU AND SAYS : # # "OH , AT LAST SOMEONE HAS COME . I HAD GIVEN UP HOPE THAT ANYONE WOULD EVER HELP ME TO GET OUT OF THIS CASTLE . PLEASE , OPEN THE DOOR TO THE CAGE AND HELP ME OUT OF HERE BEFORE THAT TERRIBLE MONSTER APPEARS AGAIN AND STARES AT ME WITH HIS MANY GREEDY EYES! QUITE APART FROM HIS HUGE JAWS WITH ALL THOSE TEETH!"
