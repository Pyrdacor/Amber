WELCOME , MY FRIEND! I HEARD ABOUT THE DEATH OF YOUR PARENTS AND AM VERY SORRY INDEED . # # WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO NOW? LET ME GUESS . . YES , I KNOW , YOU WANT TO GO TRAVELLING . YOU ALWAYS SPOKE OF DOING THAT WHEN WE WENT HUNTING IN THE FOREST . YOU CAN PROBABLY STILL REMEMBER MY FATHER , JONATHAN . AS YOU KNOW , HE DIED A FEW YEARS AGO . SHORTLY AFTERWARDS I LEFT MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND MOVED INTO THE TOWN . THE HOUSE HAS BEEN EMPTY SINCE THEN . MY FATHER INVENTED A FEW STRANGE THINGS AND PERHAPS YOU CAN STILL FIND SOME OF THEM IN THE OLD LABORATORY IN THE CELLAR AT THE HOUSE . # # I AM SURE THAT SOME OF HIS INVENTIONS COULD PROVE USEFUL FOR YOU . FOLLOW THE ROAD FROM TWINLAKE IN A NORTH EASTERLY (AND YOU WILL FIND THE HOUSE . I HID THE KEY IN THE BUSH NEXT TO THE PATH TO THE HOUSE . # # GOOD LUCK ON YOUR TRAVELS!
