ON THE WALL BEFORE YOU IS A LARGE IRON WHEEL . AS YOU START TO TURN IT , YOU HEAR A LOUD HISSING WHICH APPARENTLY IS CAUSED BY WATER FLOWING THROUGH A PIPE AT HIGH PRESSURE . YOU TURN THE WHEEL
IT STOPS , AND SUDDENLY YOU HEAR A LOUD RUSHING NOISE TO THE SOUTH . IT SOUNDS AS IF A MASS OF WATER HAS WASHED A WAY CLEAR!
