AS YOU EXAMINE THE WALL MORE CLOSELY YOU SEE THAT IT IS ONLY AN ILLUSION . AS YOU START TO GO FURTHER , YOU HEAR MORE GIGGLING AND A HIGH PITCHED VOICE SAYS : # # "I HOPE YOU LIKE OUR GAMES! # THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING . WHAT FOLLOWS WILL BE EVEN WORSE" # # SO TAKE NOTE : # "NOT ALWAYS IS EVERYTHING WHICH IS , REALITY , AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS NOT , UNREAL" # # AGAIN YOU HEAR GIGGLING WHICH THEN DISAPPEARS INTO THE DISTANCE .
