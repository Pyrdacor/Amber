SHORTLY AFTER YOU ENTER THE TELEPORT YOU FIND YOURSELVES AT A CROSSING IN THE CORRIDOR . YOU WANT TO GO STRAIGHT ON WHEN YOU HEAR GENTLE LAUGHTER AND A VOICE SAYS : # # "WELCOME TO THE LABYRINTH . # A FEW OF US WILL NOW LOOK AFTER YOU . YOU WILL FIND THEM IN THE LABYRINTH . BUT IF YOU PREFER TO LEAVE THE CAVE WITHOUT A SINGLE HAIR ON YOUR HEAD BEING HARMED , YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TELEPORTER AHEAD OF YOU"
