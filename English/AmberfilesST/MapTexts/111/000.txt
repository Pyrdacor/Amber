DARKNESS SURROUNDS YOU AND ONLY A WEAK GREEN GLOW RADIATES DOWN AT YOU FROM THE CEILING OF THE HUGE CAVE . IN THE BAY BEFORE YOU YOU SEE MANY WRECKED SHIPS . GREAT WAVES ARE CRASHING AGAINST THE WRECKS . AND AS YOU LOOK TO SEE WHERE THE WAVES COME FROM YOU SEE A GIGANTIC WHIRLPOOL SPINNING TIRELESSLY IN THE CENTRE OF THE BAY .
