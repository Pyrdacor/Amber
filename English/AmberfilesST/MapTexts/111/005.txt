YOU ARE STANDING BEFORE A HUGE PILE OF BONES . AS YOU TRY TO TURN AWAY FROM THE TERRIBLE SIGHT YOU SEE A WINDOW OPEN ABOVE THE ENTRANCE . SHORTLY AFTERWARDS A SKELETON SLIDES LOUDLY CLATTERING OUT OF THE OPENING AND CRASHES ONTO THE PILE OF BONES . THE WINDOW CLOSES AGAIN JUST AS THE LAST FEW BONES CLATTER TO THE GROUND .
