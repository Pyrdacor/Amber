AS YOU APPROACH THE CAGE YOU SEE A MAN INSIDE IT . HE IS DRESSED IN RAGS AND UNDER A THICK LAYER OF DIRT YOU NOTICE SEVERE WOUNDS ON HIS BODY . # WHEN HE SEES YOU , HE CALLS WITH A HOARSE VOICE : # # "PLEASE HELP ME , WHOEVER YOU ARE! THE WATER DEMON I SUMMONED HAS BEEN TORTURING ME FOR MANY WEEKS . PLEASE DESTROY THE DEMON AND RELEASE ME FROM THIS CAGE! # I WILL REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY!"
