THE MAN BEFORE YOU STANDS SIX FOOT TALL AND HAS A BEARD . AS YOU SPEAK TO HIM HE TURNS TO YOU AND SAYS : "HELLO , I AM ERIK , THE JEWEL'S COOK . WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES - CURRIED CHICKEN - WAIT , I WILL BRING SOME PLATES . # ERIK GOES TO ONE OF THE LARGE PANS IN THE KITCHEN BUT THEN COMES BACK EMPTY-HANDED . # "I AM REALLY VERY SORRY BUT THERE'S NOTHING LEFT . PERHAPS YOU CAN COME AGAIN?"
