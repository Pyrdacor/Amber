AN OLD MAN SITS ON THE GRASS AND LOOKS AT THE TREES . WHEN HE NOTICES YOU , HE BEGINS TO SPEAK : # # "HAVE YOU PERHAPS SEEN KELVIN , THE BARD? NORMALLY HE USED TO COME HERE ONCE A WEEK AND PLAYED THE OLD SONGS ON HIS BEAUTIFUL HARP . BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR MONTHS . I HOPE NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM!"
