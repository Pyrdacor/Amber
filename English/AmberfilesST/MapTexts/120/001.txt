QUACK QUACK! OH , PARDON ME , I MEAN OF COURSE : # # GOOD DAY! # YOU WILL BE WONDERING HOW I CAN SPEAK . WELL , A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS A PERFECTLY NORMAL DWARF . I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO GEMSTONE AS I RAN INTO THE OLD WITCH , ER , I MEAN THE HERB LADY . I GREETED HER IN QUITE A FRIENDLY MANNER AND WANTED TO CARRY ON PAST HER . . # # (BZZZZZZZZ) GULP , SLURP . $ PLEASE EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT I COULDN'T LET THAR FLY GET AWAY . NOW , WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT? # # OH YES , I KNOW : # SHE SUDDENLY SCREAMED AT ME AND TURNED ME INTO A FROG . SINCE THEN I HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE HER SO NASTY . APPARENTLY , YOU SEE , SHE HAD A CONTRACT WITH A GROUP OF GOBLINS AND SPRITES BUT PROBABLY SHE DID NOT HONOUR THE CONTRACT HERSELF AND THE COBOLDS STOLE SOMETHING IMPORTANT FROM HER . IF YOU MEET HER AND SHE IS IN A BETTER MOOD YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO HER WHILE SHE IS ON HER BROOM . # # OH , I HAVE JUST REMEMBERED : # PERHAPS ONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KISS ME? $ NO , WAIT! WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT , I FEEL QUITE SICK ABOUT GETTING KISSED BY A HUMAN . FORGET IT . # # (BZZZZZZZZ) $ OH , I AM SORRY , I MUST GO . THAT BIG BEE MUSTN'T GET AWAY . # SPLASH , QUACK .
