THIS DOOR HAS BEEN NAILED UP WITH THICK PLANKS . THERE IS A DIRTY PIECE OF PARCHMENT WHICH SHOWS IN ALMOST ILLEGIBLE HANDWRITING : # # CORRIDOR BEHIND DOOR NOT GOOD! LAST MONTH POWERFUL WARRIOR OLGUR DISAPPEARED . SO I HAVE SEALED THE CORRIDOR . NO-ONE MAY GO IN . # SIGNED : CHIEF ORK MOLOK . # # AS YOU LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE DOOR YOU SEE IT COULD EASILY BE OPENED WITH A CROWBAR .
