AS YOU SPEAK TO THE OLD WOMAN SHE LOOKS UP FROM THE GOODS SHE IS JUST TAKING OFF THE SHELF AND SAYS : # # "YOU SEEM TO BE NEW TO THE TOWN SO LET ME GIVE YOU A PIECE OF GOOD ADVICE : # KEEP AWAY FROM THE HOUSE OF LORD CHANCELLOR DREBIN! HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN DARK FORCES AND SEVERAL BLACK MASSES HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED THERE RECENTLY # # APPARENTLY HE WENT TOO FAR AND THE DEMONS CAME TO COLLECT HIM . HE DISAPPEARED A FEW WEEKS AGO AND , AS I HEARD , THERE ARE NOW DEMONS AND GHOSTS LIVING IN HIS CELLAR .
