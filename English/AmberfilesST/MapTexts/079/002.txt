IN THIS GLASS GLOBE YOU SEE A BEAUTIFUL PANORAMA : # # A SEA AND LARGE ISLAND WITH MEADOWS AND FORESTS . ON ITS SOUTH SIDE YOU CAN SEE A SMALL COTTAGE . ONE OF THE PEOPLE WITH YOU EVEN THINKS HE CAN SEE A SMALL SKELETON LYING IN THE GRASS . BUT THE THING WHICH YOU FIND STRANGEST OF ALL ABOUT THIS SCENE IS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT STILL . IT IS FULL OF MOVEMENT . YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE WAVES ON THE SEA , CLOUDS MOVING THROUGH THE AIR AND YOU EVEN THINK YOU CAN SEE BIRDS FLYING FROM TREE TO TREE .
