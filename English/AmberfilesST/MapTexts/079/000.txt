WHEN YOU ENTER THE ROOM YOU FEEL ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE SICK . THE SMELL OF CHEMICALS IS HARDLY BEARABLE . NO SOUND PENETRATES THE DARKNESS AROUND YOU . BUT THEN , WITH A SUDDEN FLASH , ALL THE TORCHES IN THE LABORATORY LIGHT UP , AS IF LIT BY A GHOST! IT LOOKS AS IF NO-ONE HAS BEEN HERE FOR YEARS . PARCHMENTS AND GLASS FLASKS ARE SCATTERED OVER THE FLOOR , THICK COBWEBS HANG FROM THE WALLS AND A SEVERAL INCHES THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE GROUND .
