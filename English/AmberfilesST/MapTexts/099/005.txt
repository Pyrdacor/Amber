AS YOU SPEAK TO THE WOMAN SHE TURNS TOWARDS YOU AND YOU SEE HER FACE IS RED WITH TEARS . SHE SOBS : # # "IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MY HUSBAND , THE LORD CHANCELLOR , THEN I MUST DISAPPOINT YOU . A FEW WEEKS AGO ONE OF HIS EXPERIMENTS IN THE CELLAR MUST HAVE GONE WRONG . HE WENT INTO THE CELLAR AND THEN , SHORTLY AFTERWARDS , I HEARD A LOUD EXPLOSION AND SOME HORRIBLE LAUGHTER . # # "FROM THE DAY I LAST SAW MY HUSBAND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REACH THE CELLAR BUT THE DOOR CAN ONLY BE OPENED WITH THE SEAL OF HIS SIGNET RING . # MY HUSBAND ONCE HAD TWO OF THESE SEALS BUT LOST ONE OF THEM SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND COULDN'T FIND IT AGAIN . # # "PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP ME TO FIND MY HUSBAND? I AM NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO DOWN INTO THE CELLAR ANY MORE , NOW THAT I HEAR THIS INHUMAN MOANING AND WAILING . PERHAPS YOU HAD FIRST BETTER TAKE A LOOK AROUND HIS STUDY IN THE TOWER . THE STAIRCASE TO THE TOWER IS LOCATED IN OUR BEDROOM ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE . I AM TOO FRIGHTENED TO LOOK THERE SINCE HE HAS BEEN HOLDING THAT STRANGE CREATURE PRISONER IN THE GLASS GLOBE .
