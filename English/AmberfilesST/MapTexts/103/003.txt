AFTER A BRIEF BLINDING FLASH OF BRIGHTNESS YOUR SIGHT RETURNS . # TO YOUR ASTONISHMENT YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE HANGING IN THE AIR APPROXIMATELY SIX INCHES ABOVE ONE OF THE TABLES IN A GUEST HOUSE . WITH A LOUD CRASH YOU FALL ONTO THE TABLE , KNOCKING OVER A FEW WINE GOBLETS .

WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FREE TABLES , THERE'S NO NEED TO RUSH .
