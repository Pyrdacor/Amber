A YOUNG MAN WITH A PALE FACE SPEAKS TO YOU : # # "DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE TEMPLE OF SANSRI? # IF SO , I MUST WARN YOU! A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT INTO THE TEMPLE WITH MY SISTER , WITHOUT PERMISSION . I WAS GLAD TO GET OUT ALIVE . IT WAS ENOUGH JUST TO GET AWAY FROM THE HORRIBLE SNAKES BUT THE WORST THING WAS THE SNAKE SYMBOLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TEMPLE . EVERY TIME I TOUCHED ONE OF THESE SYMBOLS A TERRIBLE PAIN SHOT THROUGH MY BODY . BUT THE ASTONISHING THING ABOUT THE SYMBOLS WAS THAT MY SISTER COULD TOUCH THEM WITHOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING TO HER . # SO TAKE CARE THAT YOU DO NOT ACCIDENTALLY TREAD ON ONE OF THESE SYMBOLS .
