SUDDENLY THE AIR STARTS TO FLICKER AND YOU HEAR DEVILISH LAUGHTER . SHORTLY AFTER THE LAUGHTER DIES AWAY A HUGE HORNED BEING APPEARS BEFORE THE DOOR . IT LOOKS DOWN AT YOU THROUGH GRIM RED EYES AND GROWLS IN A DEEP VOICE : # # "YOU HAVE COME FAR ENOUGH , PUNY MORTALS . YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE . TARBOS WILL BE RELEASED FROM HIS PRISON BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ALIVE TO SEE IT . PREPARE TO MEET YOUR DOOM!" # # WITH THESE WORDS BRALKUR RAISES HIS HUGE SWORD AND ATTACKS!
