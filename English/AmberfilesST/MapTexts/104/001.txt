IF MY HUSBAND , THE LANDLORD , CATCHES YOU HERE HE WILL BEAT ME TO DEATH!" # # AS YOU TURN AWAY FROM THE WOMAN TO DO AS SHE REQUESTS YOU HEAR A GENTLE TAPPING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS . # WITH A FROZEN SMILE ON HER FACE THE WOMAN SAYS : # # "YES , YES , THOSE WOODPECKERS . THEY SIMPLY CANNOT STOP MAKING THEIR NESTS UNDER THE ROOF . PLEASE , GO NOW , AND MAKE SURE THAT MY HUSBAND DOES NOT SEE YOU!"
