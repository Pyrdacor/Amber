A STRANGE SCENE IS BEFORE YOU : # # IN THE ROOM AHEAD OF YOU SEVERAL HUGE RATS HAVE GATHERED AROUND A BLOODY ALTAR . BEHIND THE ALTAR IS AN EVEN LARGER RAT WITH A CROWN ON ITS HEAD AND A DAGGER IN ITS CLAW . A SCREAMING BLACK CAT IS TIED ONTO THE ALTAR . IN A PIERCINGLY HIGH VOICE THE KING OF RATS SCREAMS : # # "FIRST THE CATS , THEN THE HUMANS!" # THEN HE SLOWLY LOWERS HIS DAGGER .
