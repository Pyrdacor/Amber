IN FRONT OF YOU IS A LARGE VOLCANIC ISLAND . ON THE EAST COAST IS AN OLD CASTLE . YOU SEE A HUGE GAPING HOLE IN THE LARGE DOMED ROOF OF THE HALL OF KNIGHTS . SUDDENLY YOU HEAR A LOUD ROARING NOISE AND A HUGE GREEN CREATURE FLIES TOWARDS THE CASTLE IN A WIDE CURVE . JUST IN FRONT OF THE DOME THE DRAGON FOLDS ITS WINGS AND DIVES THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROOF .
