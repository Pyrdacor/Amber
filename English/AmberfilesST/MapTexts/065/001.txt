SADNESS AND PAIN MOVE YOU AT THIS MOMENT . WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE YOUR PARENTS? WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE BEEN WITH THEM WHEN THE BAND OF ORCS ATTACKED THEIR COACH? DUMBFOUNDED YOU LOOK AT THE GRAVE . WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW? GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SEEK YOUR FORTUNE? WITH TEARS ON YOUR FACE YOU TURN AWAY FROM THE GRAVE . YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS FEEL THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE FROM YOUR MOTHER , A PIECE OF HER SCARF WHICH LAY AT THE EDGE OF THE LANE . APPARENTLY IT MUST HAVE BEEN TORN OFF DURING THE BATTLE WITH THE ORCS . WITH A DEEP SIGH YOU LEAVE THE GRAVE AND GO ON YOUR WAY HOME .
