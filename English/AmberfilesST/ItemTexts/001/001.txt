THIS APPEARS TO BE A PAGE OF THE DIARY : # # LYRAMION , 22-8-846 # THIS EVENING I SAW A FALLING STAR! IT SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN NOT FAR FROM HERE . # # LYRAMION , 23-8-846 # I WENT OUT THIS MORNING TO SEEK THE STAR . I FOUND IT! AS I WENT TO PICK IT UP I BURNT MY FINGERS BADLY . THE STAR WAS RED HOT! # # LYRAMION , 28-8-846 # AFTER SEVERAL DAYS RESEARCH I FOUND OUT A FEW INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE STAR . THE MOST IMPORTANT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STAR ATTRACTS OTHER METALS AND QUITE SOME POWER IS NEEDED TO REMOVE THEM AGAIN . # # LYRAMION , 30-8-846 # TODAY I REMOVED THE METAL FROM THE STAR . I SHALL CALL THIS NEW METAL "MAGNET" . # # LYRAMION , 02-9-846 # AT LAST I HAVE FOUND A USE FOR THE NEW METAL , BUT I MUST ADMIT THAT IT WAS BY CHANCE . WHEN I WAS WORKING THE METAL A SWORD-SHAPED PART BROKE OFF IT . THIS BROKEN PIECE LANDED ON A FLOATING BLOCK OF WOOD , PART OF MY EXPERIMENTS WITH WATER . THE CURIOUS THING IS THAT THE SWORD ALWAYS POINTED TO THE NORTH! I THEN DEVELOPED A DEVICE IN WHICH THE SWORD ALWAYS POINTS IN THE SAME (. THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT INVENTION FOR MARINERS! FROM NOW ON , NAVIGATORS WILL NO LONGER NEED TO DEPEND ON HAVING A CLEAR , CLOUDLESS SKY TO KNOW THEIR (. I BELIEVE I SHALL CALL THIS DEVICE A COMPASS . # # LYRAMION , 12-11-846 # TODAY I INVITED SEVERAL SEA CAPTAINS TO DINNER AND SHOWED THEM THE COMPASS . BUT THE EVENING WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTING , I COULD NOT CONVINCE THEM OF THE VALUE OF THE DEVICE . UNANIMOUSLY THEY TOLD ME THEY STILL PREFERRED TO USE THE SUN AND STARS RATHER THAN TO TRUST THEIR LIFE TO SUCH A SMALL THING MADE OF WOOD AND METAL . SO I PUT THE COMPASS IN THE SECRET CHAMBER BEHIND THE FIREPLACE . PERHAPS I CAN USE IT AGAIN SOME TIME .
