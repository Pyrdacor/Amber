THIS APPEARS TO BE A PAGE FROM THE DIARY : # # LYRAMION , 12-3-848 # I HAD VISITORS TODAY! THE GREAT ADVISER OF THE PHARAOH RELANUKH CAME PERSONALLY TO SEE ME , BRINGING AN INSTRUCTION FROM HIS MASTER . THE PHARAOH ASKED WHETHER I COULD DEVELOP A NEW MEANS OF TRANSPORT FOR HIM . IN HIS OLD AGE HE NO LONGER WANTED TO HAVE TO CLIMB ONTO CAMELS , AND THEIR BUMPY , ROLLING MOTION MADE HIM FEEL SICK . # # LYRAMION , 18-5-848 # TODAY I INFORMED THE PHARAOH THAT MY WORK WIS COMPLETE AND HE CAN ARRANGE TO HAVE THE DEVICE COLLECTED . THE GREAT ADVISER WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN HE SAW MY INVENTION : A SMALL BLUE DISC WHICH , WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE FLOOR , EXPANDS TO SEVERAL YARDS IN DIAMETER AND HOVERS A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE GROUND . AFTER A SHORT TEST FLIGHT THE PHARAOH'S ADVISOR WAS CONVINCED BY THE FLYING DISC AND GENEROUSLY REWARDED ME ON BEHALF OF THE PHARAOH . THEN HE LEFT TO TAKE THE FLYING DISC TO HIS MASTER IN THE GREAT DESERT TO THE SOUTH EAST . # # LYRAMION , 8-7-852 # I HEARD TODAY THAT PHARAOH RELANUKH DIED LAST MONTH AND MY FLYING DISC HAS BEEN PLACED IN HIS TOMB . ACTUALLY I AM VERY GLAD THAT THE FLYING DISC IS NO LONGER IN USE . LAST YEAR I DISCOVERED IT HAS CERTAIN WEAKNESSES CONCERNING THE TERRAIN ON WHICH IT CAN BE USED . IN THE DESERT , OVER MEADOWS AND RIVERS IT CAN BE VERY USEFUL BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS IF IT IS USED TO TRAVEL THROUGH FORESTS OR ON THE SEA . # # LYRAMION , 16-6-856 # I HAVE NOW HEARD ABOUT MANY ADVENTURERS WHO TRIED TO ENTER THE TOMB OF THE PHARAOH IN ORDER TO FIND THE LEGENDARY MAGIC FLYING DISC . I ASK MYSELF WHY THEY DO NOT SIMPLY COME TO ME TO ORDER A NEW FLYING DISC , INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEIR LIFE AT RISK . .
