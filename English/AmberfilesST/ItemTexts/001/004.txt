THIS APPEARS TO BE A PAGE FROM THE DIARY : # # LYRAMION , 15-1-851 # THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF CRYSTAL VISITED ME TODAY AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAS PROBLEMS WITH HIS NIGHT GUARDS BECAUSE THE SUNDIAL DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT AND THE GUARDS ALWAYS MISS THE TIMES WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO CHANGE . HE NEEDS SOMETHING WHICH CAN SHOW THE RIGHT TIME EVEN AT NIGHT . WHEN THE LORD CHANCELLOR LEFT , I FOUND HIS SIGNET RING . I WILL KEEP THE RING SAFE
I MEET THE LORD CHANCELLOR AGAIN . # # LYRAMION , 30-1-851 # I FINISHED THE WORK ON THE CLOCK TODAY AND I CAN SEND IT TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR . # # LYRAMION , 25-2-851 # I TODAY RECEIVED A LETTER OF THANKS FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF CRYSTAL . THE LETTER EXPRESSED HIS DEEP GRATITUDE FOR THE CLOCK AND HE TELLS ME THAT THE GUARDS ARE NOW CHANGED VERY PUNCTUALLY . HE ALSO SAYS I SHOULD VISIT HIM IF I AM EVER IN CRYSTAL .
