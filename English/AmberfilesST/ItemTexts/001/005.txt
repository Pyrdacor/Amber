THIS APPEARS TO BE A PAGE FROM THE DIARY : # # LYRAMION , 24-7-854 # TODAY I COMPLETED WHAT IS PROBABLY MY GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT . I CREATED MY OWN WORLD! ALTHOUGH MY WORLD CONSISTS JUST OF A SEA AND AN ISLAND , I AM NEVERTHELESS DELIGHTED! # # LYRAMION , 13-9-854 # TODAY I FINISHED WORK ON MY HOUSE ON THE ISLAND . IT IS VERY COSY HERE! NOBODY CAN DISTURB ME AND I HAVE MY PEACE AND QUIET . # # LYRAMION , 19-11-854 # MY WORK ON THE WORLD GLOBE GAVE ME A NEW IDEA WHICH I THEN IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO PRACTICE . ONE COULD CONSIDER THE DEVICE I CREATED AS A MINIATURE VERSION OF THE GREAT GLOBE . BUT THIS IS NOT QUITE RIGHT . THERE IS NO WORLD IN THE CRYSTAL GLOBE BUT YOU CAN SEE A KIND OF BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE REGION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED . HOWEVER , I NOTICED THAT THE GLOBE GOES VERY CLOUDY AT PLACES WHERE THERE IS A STRONG MAGICAL FORCE . # # LYRAMION , 24-11-854 # WHILST PLAYING CARDS IN TWINLAKE TODAY I GAMBLED AND LOST THE CRYSTAL BALL TO THE COOK AT THE "DANCING DRAGON" . IT WAS NOT A GREAT LOSS : I WILL SIMPLY BUILD A NEW ONE SOMETIMESOON . # # LYRAMION , 25-11-854 # ONE BIT OF BAD LUCK SELDOM COMES ALONE! ON MY WAY TO TWINLAKE I WAS TODAY ATTACKED BY A HUGE GREEN DRAGON (IT WAS AT LEAST A YARD AND A HALF HIGH!) ALTHOUGH I WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY , THE BEAST STOLE MY BAG . AND THE WORST THING IS THAT THE BAG CONTAINS THE KEY TO THE EXIT FROM THE WORLD GLOBE . I JUST HOPE THAT NOBODY ACCIDENTALLY TRAVELS TO THE ISLAND THROUGH THE TELEPORTER . I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO RELEASE HIM AGAIN .
