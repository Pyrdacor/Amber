THIS APPEARS TO BE A PAGE FROM THE DIARY : # # LYRAMION , 24-11-850 # TODAY MY OLD FRIEND MELVIN , THE CAPTAIN OF THE CONSTRUCTION BRIGADE , VISITED ME AND TOLD ME OF HIS PROBLEM . HE SAID HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP TO THE SOUTH WEST OF TWINLAKE . WITH HIS BRIGADE HE BUILT A HUGE SYSTEM OF DRAINS UNDER THE SWAMP , BUT NOW HE IS AFRAID TO ENTER THE DRAINS BECAUSE HE HAS ALREADY LOST HIS WAY THERE TWICE AND WOULD BE ASHAMED IF HE HAD TO BE RESCUED AGAIN BY HIS OWN PEOPLE . SO I TOLD HIM I WOULD THINK ABOUT HIS PROBLEM AND HE SHOULD COME AND SEE ME AGAIN BEFORE HE GOES BACK TO THE GRALSWAMP (GRALSUMPFE) # # LYRAMION , 28-11-850 # TODAY I WAS PROUDLY ABLE TO HAND OVER MY LOCATOR DEVICE TO MELVIN . HE WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I SHOWED HIM WHAT IT CAN DO . THE LOCATOR ALWAYS SHOWS THE CORRECT POSITION , WHEREVER ONE IS IN LYRAMION . FROM NOW ON MELVIN SHOULD NEVER LOSE HIS WAY AGAIN . # # LYRAMION , 2-3-853 # TODAY I RECEIVED THE SAD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF MY FRIEND MELVIN . AS THE LETTER SAYS , A CONSTRUCTION BRIGADE UNDER HIS CHARGE WAS ATTACKED BY HORRID MONSTERS IN ONE OF THE NEW DRAINS . THE LETTER ALSO SAYS THAT AFTER THE ATTACK PART OF THE DRAIN COLLAPSED . YES , YES - HOW DID THE OLD DWARF SAYING GO : "DO NOT WAKEN THE TERROR SLEEPING IN THE DEEP" . # # AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE YOU CAN READ THE FOLLOWING : REPLY : WATER
