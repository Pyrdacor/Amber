MOST PAGES OF THE DIARY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY THE WEATHER . THE ONLY ENTRIES YOU CAN STILL READ ARE THE FOLLOWING : # # 1 . # AFTER SO MANY YEARS I NOW HAVE THE MAGIC SPELLS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO PUT MY PLAN INTO OPERATION . TOMORROW I WILL INVESTIGATE THE SECRET OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY . # # 2 . # DAMN! WHAT A TIME FOR A FAULT IN TRANSFORMER NUMBER . . # # 3 . # ALL IS IN ORDER . TOMORROW I WILL TRY IT AND IF EVERYTHING WORKS AS I PLANNED , I'LL BE THE BEST AND MOST POWERFUL WIZARD EVER TO EXIST IN LYRAMION . # # THE LAST ENTRY YOU CAN STILL DECIPHER IS VERY UNCLEAR AND DIFFICULT TO READ , AND YOU IMAGINE IT WAS NOT WRITTEN BY THE SAME PERSON WHO MADE THE PREVIOUS ENTRIES : # # 4 . # I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE MY LAST ENTRY IN THE DIARY . I FEEL MY SPIRIT IS DISAPPEARING AND MY BODY IS CHANGING . BUT THE CHANGES ARE NOT AS I WANTED THEM TO BE . I BELIEVE I WAS TOO AMBITIOUS AND AM BEING PUNISHED BY THE GODS .
