CRYSTAL , 15-1-876 # HURRAH , I HAVE TODAY SUCCEEDED IN TRANSFERING THE LIFE FORCE OF A MINOR DEMON INTO MY HOMUNCULUS . THE BEAST TRIED TO BITE ME AND FOR THAT REASON I LOCKED HIM IN THE GLASS CAGE . I WILL SHOW HIM WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE! # # CRYSTAL , 27-2-876 # I FINISHED THE CAGE IN THE CELLAR TODAY . NOW EVERYTHING IS READY AND TONIGHT I WILL TRY TO CALL UP A POWERFUL DEMON . THE ONLY THING WHICH BOTHERS ME AT THE MOMENT IS THAT DAIMON , AS I CALL THE HOMUNCULUS , HAS STILL NOT ACCEPTED ME AS HIS MASTER . BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER . IN THE PENTAGRAM NO DEMON CAN HARM ME AND THE CAGE IN THE CELLAR IS STRONG ENOUGH TO STOP EVEN BRALKUR , THE PRINCE OF HELL .
