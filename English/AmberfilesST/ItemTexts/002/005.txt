THIS PARCHMENT DESCRIBES THE WAY TO THE TOWER OF THE RIDDLEMASTER : # # "HELLO , KELVIN . IF YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR HARP BACK , YOU MUST GO ALONG THE FOLLOWING PATH : # FIRST YOU GET YOURSELF A SHIP AT THE HARBOUR IN CRYSTAL . I HOPE YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD TO DO SO , HA HA . YOU START YOUR JOURNEY BY TRAVELLING SOUTH . ASSOON AS THE SOUTH COAST OF THE BIG BAY COMES INTO SIGHT , TURN YOUR SHIP TO THE EAST AND FOLLOW THE COAST . AFTER SOME TIME THE COAST THEN CURVES AWAY TO THE SOUTH . KEEP FOLLOWING IT . WHERE THE COAST TURNS TO THE WEST YOU MUST CONTINUE STRAIGHT AHEAD . IF YOU ARE LUCKY YOU WILL FIND MY ISLAND .
